  <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 1</h1>
  <h3>
    JS is a high-level, object-oriented, multiparadigm programming language.
  </h3>
  <div class="explanation">
    <p>
      1.
      <span>HIGH-LEVEL: </span>
      Is considered high-level because it is closer to human languages and
      further from machine languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.
      <span>MULTIPARADIGM: </span>
      Flexible and versatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.
      <span>OBJECT-ORIENTED: </span>
      Relies on the concept of objects to store most types of data.
    </p>

        <th class="thBody" width="600px">
          1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population'
          and assign their values according to your own country (population in
          millions). <br />
          2. Log their values to the console.

          1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland', and set its value according
          to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also
          declare a variable 'language', but don't assing it any value yet.<br />
          2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and
          'language' to the console.

          1. Set the value 'language' to the language spoken where you live
          (some countries have multiple languages, but choose one).<br />
          2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which
          values will never change, and which might change?). Then charge this
          variables to const. <br />
          3. Try to change on of the changed variables now, and observe what
          happens.

          1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half
          the population, then how many people would live in each half?<br />
          2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result
          to the console.<br />
          3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have
          more people than Finland?<br />
          4. The average population of a country in 33 million people. Does
          your country have less people than the average country? <br />
          5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable
          'description' which contains a string with this format:
          <i>
            'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million people speak
            portuguese'.

          1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, log a
          string like this to the console:
          <i>'Portugal's population is above average'</i>. Otherwise, log a
          string like
          <i>'Portugal's population is 22 million bellow average'</i> (the 22
          is the average of 33 minus the country's population).<br />
          2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to
          13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the
          population back to original.

          1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like
          this:<br /><br />
          prompt ('how many neighbour countries does your country have?');<br /><br />
          2. If there is only one neighbour, log to the console
          <i>'Only one border!'</i> (use loose equality == for now).<br />
          3. Use an else-if block to log 'More tha 1 border' in case
          'numNeighbours' is greater than 1.<br />
          4. Use an else block to log <i>'No borders'</i> (this block will be
          executed when <i>'numNeighbours'</i> is 0 or any other value).<br />
          5. Test then code with different values of <i>'numNeighbours'</i>,
          including 1 and 0.<br />
          6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values
          of <i>'numNeighbours'</i>. Notice what happens when there is exactly
          1 border! Why is happening?<br />
          7. Finally, convert <i>'numNeighbours'</i> to a number, and watch
          what happens now when you input 1.<br />
          8.Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion
          in this situation.

          1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the
          way.<br />
          2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She
          wants to live in a country that speaks english, has less than 50
          million people and is not an island.<br />
          3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is
          right for her.<br />
          &#127;&#127;You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria.Take your time with
          this, and check part of the solution if necessary.<br />
          4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this:
          <i>'You should live in Portugal :)'</i>.
          If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.<br />
          5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily 
          change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in Canada :D).

          1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
          to log a string like this to the console: 
          <i>'Portugal's population is above average'</i>.<br />
          Otherwise, simply log <i>'Portugal's population is below average'</i>. 
          Notice how only one word changes
          between these two sentences!<br />
          2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. 
          See the diferent results and set the population back to original.
