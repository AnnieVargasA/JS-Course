            <i>'percentageOfWorld1'</i>

            <i>'population'</i>
            value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the
            given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million
            people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.<br />
            2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given
            <i>'population'</i>
            value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.<br />
            3. Call
            <i>'percentageOfWorld1'</i>
            for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results
            into variables, and log them to the console.<br />
            4. Create a
            <b>function expression</b>
            which does the exact same thing, called
            <i>'percentageOfWorld2'</i>, and also call it with 3 country

            <i>'country'</i>

            <i>'population'</i>, and returns a string like this:

            <i>'neighbours'</i><br />
            2. Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true
            or false).<br />
            3.Create an array called for these 4 population values. Use the
            function

          </th>
          <th class="thBody" width="600px">
            1. Create an array containing all the neighbours countriesof a
            country of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3
            neighbours. Store the array into a variable called
            <i>'neighbours'</i>
            <br />
            2. At some point, a new country called
            <i>'Utopia'</i>
            is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country. So remove
            it from the end of the
            <i>'neighbours'</i>
            array.<br />
            3. Unfortunately, after some time, the new country is dissolved. So
            remove it from the end of the array.<br />
            4. If the
            <i>'neighbours'</i>
            array does not include the country
            <i>'Germany'</i>, log to the console:
            <i>'Probably not a central European country :D'</i>.<br />
            5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do
            that, find the index of the country in the
            <i>'neighbours'</i>
            array, and then use that index to change the array at that index
            position. For example, you can search for
            <i>'Sweden'</i>
            in the array, and then replace it with
            <i>'Republic of Sweden'</i>.

            1. Create an object called

            <i>'country'</i>, <i>'capital'</i>, <i>'language'</i>,

            >.
            <br />
            2. Increase the country's population by two million using
            <b>dot notation</b>, and then decrease it by two million using

            1. Add a method called <i>'describe'</i> to the
            <i>'myCountry'</i> object. This method will log a string to the
            console, similar to the string logged in the previous assignment,
            but this time using the <i>'this'</i> keyword.
            <br />
            2. Call the <i>'describe'</i> method.
            <br />
            3. Add a method called <i>'checkIsland'</i> to the
            <i>'myCountry'</i> object. This method will set a new property on
            the object, called <i>'isIsland'</i>. <i>'isIsland'</i> will be true
            if there are no neighbouring countries, and false if there are. Use
            the ternary operator to set the property.

            <i>'percentages2'</i> containing the percentages of the world
            population for the 4 population values. Use the function
            <i>'percentageOfWorld1'</i> that you created earlier.
            <br />
            3. Confirm that <i>'percentages2'</i> contains exactly the same
            values as the <i>'percentages'</i> array that we created manually in
            the previous assignment, and reflect on how much better this
            solution is.

            3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a
            bit tricky, so don't worry if it's too difficult for you! But you
            can still try to figure this out anyway.
